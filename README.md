This is a forked version of gatsby-plugin-google-gtag-cookieconsent updated with Google Consent Mode V2 (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-google-gtag-cookieconsent/)

This offers the same functionality as the original plugin, the only difference is that gatsby-ssr.js has been extended to include support for consent mode v2 by setting default consent state to denied for the new consent mode v2 tags.

Install the package via npm install --save gatsby-plugin-google-gtag-cookieconsent-consent-mode
